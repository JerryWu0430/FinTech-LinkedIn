Better than Google?
Jeff Bezos has invested in Perplexity through his investment firm Bezos Expeditions. Perplexity is building an "answer engine" that responds directly to questions in text form rather than providing links, using AI technology from OpenAI.

It aims to challenge the dominance of Google in search by directly answering questions rather than just returning links. Perplexity has raised $74 million in funding at a valuation of $520 million.
